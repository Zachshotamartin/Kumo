# Kumo

Kumo is a web-based design and prototyping tool built using **React** and **Firebase**, inspired by **Figma** and **Notion**. With Kumo, users can create, collaborate, and design interactive prototypes with an added unique feature: the ability to link objects in one page to other pages seamlessly. The ability to link pages together is a fundamental inspiration drawn from **Notion**. I wished for more freedom to place objects in Notion as well as the improved linking features that are not available in **Figma**.
