## ‚úÖ COMPLETED FIXES

### **P0 Critical Issues (4/5 completed)**

#### 1. ‚úÖ Shape Reversal When Dragging Past Corners

**File**: `src/classes/shape.ts`
**What was fixed**:

- Added coordinate swapping logic when dragging past opposite corners
- Implemented Math.round() for pixel precision to prevent drift
- Fixed both regular shapes and component shapes
- Added proper division-by-zero checks

**Impact**: Shapes now properly reverse when resizing past opposite edges, eliminating confusing UX behavior.

#### 3. ‚úÖ Z-Index Component Calculation Problems

**File**: `src/classes/shape.ts`
**What was fixed**:

- Simplified complex z-index recalculation algorithm
- Components now use highest z-index from selected shapes
- Eliminated problematic z-index gaps and reordering
- Proper bounds calculation using Math.min/max for both x1,x2 and y1,y2

**Impact**: Components now maintain proper visual layering without z-index conflicts.

#### 4. ‚úÖ Inconsistent Shape Selection Logic

**File**: `src/utils/ShapeSelectionManager.ts` (NEW)
**What was created**:

- Centralized ShapeSelectionManager class with clear state machine
- Proper z-index-based shape selection (topmost shape wins)
- Predictable shift+click behavior for additive selection
- Comprehensive resize handle detection with zoom scaling
- Clear separation between canvas clicks and shape clicks

**Impact**: Selection behavior is now predictable and consistent across all interactions.

#### 5. ‚úÖ Missing Error Boundaries

**Files**: `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (NEW), updated WhiteBoard and UniversalShapeRenderer
**What was created**:

- Comprehensive ErrorBoundary component with fallback UI
- ShapeErrorBoundary for individual shape rendering protection
- Higher-order component wrapper utility
- Development mode error details and production-ready error handling
- Shape rendering protection and UI element protection

**Impact**: Single malformed shapes no longer crash the entire canvas, with graceful error recovery.

### **P1 High Priority Issues (4/5 completed)**

#### 6. ‚úÖ Rounded Width Shape Drift

**Status**: Already fixed by P0 Issue #1 Math.round() implementation
**Impact**: Eliminated gradual shape drift during repeated resize operations.

#### 7. ‚úÖ Resize Handle Detection Edge Cases

**File**: `src/utils/ResizeHandleDetection.ts` (NEW)
**What was created**:

- Advanced resize handle detection with proper zoom scaling
- Dynamic handle size calculation (8px base, 6-16px range)
- Proper cursor feedback for all resize directions
- Corner prioritization over edges for better UX
- Comprehensive direction detection and cursor mapping

**Impact**: Resize handles now work consistently at all zoom levels.

#### 8. ‚úÖ No Component Ungrouping Functionality

**File**: `src/classes/shape.ts`
**What was added**:

- `ungroupComponent()` function with proper z-index restoration
- `canUngroup()` validation function
- `getUngroupPreview()` for user feedback
- Proper level adjustment when extracting child shapes
- Z-index adjustment for remaining shapes

**Impact**: Users can now undo component creation, restoring individual shapes with proper layering.

#### 10. ‚úÖ Grid Snapping Distance Calculation

**File**: `src/utils/GridSnapping.ts` (NEW)
**What was created**:

- Comprehensive GridSnapping class with tolerance-based snapping
- Multi-type snap points: grid, shape edges, centers, midpoints
- Zoom-aware snap threshold calculation
- Priority system for different snap types
- Visual snap guides with color coding
- Shape exclusion for selected objects
- Rectangle snapping for multi-point objects

**Impact**: Grid snapping now works reliably with configurable tolerance instead of exact coordinate matching.
